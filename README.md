# Snack Truck App

This is an app created as a homework assignment for Zonar. It is a very basic version of an Android app a food truck company 
could use on phones/tablets so customers could all be ordering instead of waiting in line.

The first and second use case have both been completed to the point where I felt satisfied with how they turned out (although
code can always be refactored to look and/or run better) and have been merged in to master.

Use case three has been gotten to the put of being useable although I don't feel the code was as...nice...as it could be and
I know there are cases that could break it so it has not been merged in to master but has been left as an open pull request.

A design change that could be done to use case three could be to have two seperate logins created (if the food trucks didn't
want a dedicated phone/tablet), one for customers (and the ones logged in to all devices going outside the truck) and one for
the owner (that would be inside the truck).
